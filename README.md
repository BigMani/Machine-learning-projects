# Machine Learning projects

This project includes a comprehensive set of machine learning models using real-world datasets. Implementations include data processing and filtering, regression, classification, clustering, deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing, dimensionality reduction, and model assessment and validation.

## Contents

- Data Preprocessing: Missing data, text parsing, categorical variables, independent and dependent variables

- Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression

- Classification: Logistic Regression, K-Neural Networks (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification

- Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

- Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat

- Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling

- Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for Natural Language processing (NLP)

- Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks

- Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Kernel PCA

- Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost


### Prerequisites

- Python2 or Python3
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn
- Matpolotlib
- Pandas

### Installing

There are many ways to install python for your environment. I personally use Conda to manage python libraries

First, download the anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

If you're on a Mac OS, enter the following command in terminal to install.
```
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the remaining installation steps to install Anaconda Navigator to manage your python environments and packages.
